### tips
- help /<keyword/>
	- gives help on a specific metasploit command
- many ways to search things up
	- [here](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/39/section/404)
- setg: globally sets parameters until program restarted
- you can use grep in metasploit
	- can chain it so it greps the output of previous grep (don't use `|`)

### what are things
- target
	- the particular operating system and version of it
	- exploits are different depending on the target
	- if target is not manually set, metasploit will do its own version detection and automatically set target
- payload
	- single
		- contains exploit and entire shellcode
		- more stable
	- staged
		- multiple stages
			- stage 0: establish a network connection
			- stage 1: send shell payload over connection
			- later stages: makes shell stable, harder to detect, and more
- note
	- if there is a `/` in payload name, it is staged
	- meterpreter lets you use linux commands on windows machines
	- metasploit contains its own collection of pentest tools (plugins)
	- local exploit suggester in msfconsole suggests exploits
- encoder
	- use
		- obfuscation/ids evasion
		- makes payload compatible with target architecture
		- decreases risk of shell dying because of errors on target
- organization
	- store all findings (targets, versions) in postgresql database to get suggestions in msfconsole
	- use workspaces to seperate databases
	- exploit and sessions can be used to run multiple payloads at the same time
- importing modules
	- upload module to `.msf4` or `metasploit-framework` folder (in addition to relevant subfields and file name)
	- wrong naming convention may cause errors
	- `reload_all` inside `msfconsole`
- Firewall/IDS 
	- security policies
		- ACL lists
		- Signature, Heuristic, Stateful, and Live monitoring detection methods
	- evasion
		- don't use default templates, use msfvenom templates 
			- (msf6 default uses unique payloads each time)
		- encrypt your payloads (msf6 meterpeter does this)
		- recompille meterpreter from source code (after changing it a lil)
